//first talk about the protocol 
http protocol is the protocol used for normal client server connection which is connection per request 
on every request there is a single task being perfromed and response is send back to the client single channel connection is only established

a full duplex protocol needs to be established 
the connection is one time and is not terminated till either of the party that is cleint or server disconnects
